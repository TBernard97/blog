This is a blog where I talk about things that you usually cannot talk about especially if the context of what is being talked about consisted of things made for the sole purpose of not being talked about which if talked about might be illegal...

As for me my name is Timothy Bernard, and I am currently a graduate student studying data science and cyber security engineering. I work as an IT contractor and research assistant at my university.

When I am not studying or working or getting my ass kicked in muay thai practice I procrastinate by spending time breaking into vulnerable applications for my own amusement. The legal way of course.

If you share a similar interest or are just bored feel free to contact me via one of the three social links on top.
